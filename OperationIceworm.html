            <p>Just hearing the name may give you shivers. It sounds like some alien speices has attacked earth! The real objective may not be as scary, but it is just as wierd-digging a tunnel under Greenland!! The American scientists who worked in this project were trying to use missiles that could reach the Soviet Union if they were put on the eastern shore of Greenland. However, soon into the operation, many problems started to arise, and the Americans abandoned the plan. Now, due to climate change, the ice has meltec, exposing the tunnels.</p>
