            <p>     Alvin York was born in Cumberland, Tennesee. When the U.S. joined World War I, York was drafted into the army because it did not recognize York's religion, which was against war. Soon, he found himself in the 82nd Infantary Division, which participated in the Meuse-Argonne offensive, which aimed to push through German lines across the French-Belgian border and the French-German border. The offensive operation took place on October in 1918, at the tail end of the war. It was in this operation that Alvin York would become one of the most famous people of World War I. York and 16 other men were on a mission to take out a German Machine gun nest that obstructed their regiment's path. Soon into the battle, the patrol had already lost their commanding officers, so York was in charge. He killed some German soldiers before he was pinned down by the machine gun in the machine gun nest. It took some time, but he used his gun to pick off the Germans in the Machine gun nest. Soon, they were silenced. Finally, in a last attempt to kill York, several Germans charged him, but York was still able to defend his ground. The German commanding officer, thinking he was facing a much bigger force than a couple Americans, surrendered his unit of 90 men. York picked up even more prisoners as they marched back to camp. For his brave actions that day, among many other awards given to him, he was awarded the medal of honor. </p>
